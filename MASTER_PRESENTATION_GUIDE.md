Government pays subscription = Primary revenue
NGO premium features = Secondary revenue
Usage-based pricing = Tertiary revenue
```

### **Remember what's unique**
```
Other apps: Volunteers ‚Üî NGOs
CareConnect: Volunteers ‚Üî NGOs ‚Üî Government (with API)
             ^ This third layer is the innovation
```

‚úÖ Show code only if asked
‚úÖ Focus on business model more than technical details
‚úÖ Practice the demo 2-3 times before real thing
