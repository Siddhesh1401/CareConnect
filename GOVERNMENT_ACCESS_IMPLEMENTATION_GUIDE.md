## 🔧 Email System Implementation

### 1. Email Monitoring & Parsing (`backend/src/scripts/emailMonitor.ts`)

**Purpose:** Automatically monitor Gmail inbox for government data access requests

**Key Features:**
- **IMAP Connection:** Secure connection to Gmail using app passwords
- **Subject Filtering:** Only processes emails with "Government Data Access Request" subject
- **Unread Processing:** Only processes unread emails to avoid duplicates
- **Robust Parsing:** Extracts structured data from email body text
- **Sender Validation:** Uses actual sender email address (not parsed content)

- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error logging and graceful failure handling

**Email Parsing Logic:**
```typescript
// Parses emails in format:
// Organization: Test Government Agency
// Contact Person: John Doe
// Email: john.doe@govtmail.com
// Purpose: Research on NGO activities
// Data Types: volunteers, ngos, campaigns
// ...etc

function parseEmailBody(body: string): EmailData | null {
  // Extracts all fields using key-value parsing
  // Maps data types: volunteers → volunteer_data, ngos → ngo_data, etc.
  // Validates required fields and returns structured data
}
```

**Monitoring Process:**
1. Connect to Gmail IMAP
2. Search for unread emails with specific subject
3. Parse email content into structured data
4. Validate and create database records
5. Mark emails as read
6. Return processing statistics
