## 🚀 Sharing Options

### Option 1: GitHub Repository (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Name: `CareConnect` or `careconnect-platform`
4. Description: "A comprehensive platform connecting volunteers with NGOs"
5. Make it **Public** for team collaboration
6. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

#### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CareConnect.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin sid

# Also push main branch if needed
git checkout main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 3: Share with Team
Send your team members:
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CareConnect`
- Setup instructions: "See README.md and backend/SETUP.md"

### Option 2: Direct File Sharing

#### Create a Zip Package
```bash
# Create a zip of the entire project (excluding node_modules)
# Manually zip the CareConnect folder, making sure:
# ✅ Include: src/, backend/, *.md files, package.json files
# ❌ Exclude: node_modules/, .env files
```

## 👥 Team Member Setup Instructions

### For Git Clone (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CareConnect.git
cd CareConnect

# Checkout your development branch
git checkout sid

# Backend Setup
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with team platform email credentials
npm install
