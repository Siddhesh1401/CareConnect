# ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## The Issue Was FOUND & FIXED âœ…

**The API Admin Dashboard was NOT visible on your site because of a route mismatch**

### What Was Wrong
- Header tried to navigate to: `/api-admin/dashboard`
- App router only knew about: `/admin/api-dashboard`
- **Result:** 404 Error - page not found

### What I Fixed
âœ… Changed App.tsx routes to match header navigation:
- `/admin/api-dashboard` â†’ `/api-admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/email-requests` â†’ `/api-admin/email-requests`

## Run These Commands NOW

```bash
# 1. Build the frontend
npm run build

# 2. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to your site and:
1. Log in as API Admin
2. Click "Dashboard" in the navigation
3. **NOW IT SHOULD WORK!** âœ…

## What Should Work Now

âœ… Dashboard loads at `/api-admin/dashboard`
âœ… View API Keys tab
âœ… View Key Details modal (click "View Details")
âœ… Generate new API keys
âœ… Revoke API keys
âœ… Access Requests tab
âœ… Approve/Reject requests
âœ… Edit API keys modal
âœ… All buttons and modals functional
