## Console Messages to Look For

### When Loading Volunteers ‚úÖ
```javascript
‚úì "Volunteer Management - API Response: {...}"
‚úì "Volunteers received: [{name: 'John', email: 'john@...'}]"
```

### If No Volunteers ‚úì (This is normal!)
```javascript
‚úì "Volunteer Management - API Response: {...}"
‚úì "Volunteers received: []"  // Empty array = no registrations yet
```

### If Error ‚ùå
```javascript
‚úó "Failed to fetch volunteers - Success is false or undefined"
‚úó "Error fetching volunteers: ..."
```

## API Flow

### Getting Volunteers Data
```
Frontend Request:
GET /api/events/ngo/volunteers
Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}
        ‚Üì
Backend:
1. Checks if user is NGO_ADMIN ‚úì
2. Finds all events where organizerId = user._id
3. Collects all registeredVolunteers from those events
4. Deduplicates (same volunteer in multiple events = count once)
5. Returns volunteer list + stats
        ‚Üì
Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "volunteers": [...],
    "stats": {...}
  }
}
```

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why don't volunteers automatically show up?
**A**: They must explicitly register for your events. It's by choice, not automatic!

### Q: Can I manually add volunteers?
**A**: Not in current design. They must register through the event registration flow.

### Q: How do I promote my events to get more volunteers?
**A**: 
- Use the Broadcast feature to send messages to all volunteers
- Share event links on social media
- Post in communities
- Update event descriptions to be compelling

### Q: What if a volunteer registers but then unregisters?
**A**: They'll disappear from your volunteer list (they're no longer registered for any of your events)

### Q: Can volunteers see my past events?
**A**: They can see all events (past and upcoming) but can only register for future events

### Q: How do I track volunteer hours?
**A**: System currently calculates hours based on event duration. You can manually adjust if needed.
