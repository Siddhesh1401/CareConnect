# üìä NGO Data Management - Multi-NGO System Explained

**Question:** If there are multiple NGOs on my site, is their data stored separately? What happens when we delete an NGO?

**Answer:** YES - Each NGO's data is stored separately and connected via their User ID (organizerId). When an NGO is deleted, their data handling depends on how the deletion is implemented.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture - How NGO Data is Organized

### 1. **User Collection** (NGO Admin Account)

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: "Helping Hands NGO",
  email: "admin@helpinghands.com",
  role: "ngo_admin",
  
  // NGO-specific fields
  organizationName: "Helping Hands",
  organizationType: "Relief",
  registrationNumber: "NGO123456",
  description: "We help underprivileged children",
  website: "https://helpinghands.com",
  
  // Verification Status
  verificationStatus: "approved",
  isNGOVerified: true,
  
  // Account Status
  accountStatus: "active",
  isActive: true,
  
  joinedDate: "2024-01-01"
}
```

### 2. **Events Collection** (Created by NGO)

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: "Community Cleanup Drive",
  organizerId: ObjectId,  // ‚Üê Links to NGO's User._id
  organizerName: "Helping Hands",
  organizationName: "Helping Hands NGO",
  
  status: "published",
  registeredVolunteers: [
    { userId: ObjectId, userName: "John", status: "confirmed" },
    { userId: ObjectId, userName: "Jane", status: "confirmed" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Campaigns Collection** (Created by NGO)

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: "Education Fund Campaign",
  ngoId: ObjectId,  // ‚Üê Links to NGO's User._id
  ngoName: "Helping Hands",
  
  status: "active",
  target: 100000,
  raised: 50000,
  donations: [
    { donorId: ObjectId, amount: 5000, ... },
    { donorId: ObjectId, amount: 2000, ... }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Stories Collection** (Created by NGO)

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: "Success Story - Village Education",
  authorId: ObjectId,  // ‚Üê Links to NGO's User._id
  authorName: "Helping Hands",
  
  impact: "We educated 200 children",
  images: ["story1.jpg", "story2.jpg"]
}
```

### 5. **Reports Collection** (Filed by NGO)

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: "Monthly Activity Report",
  reportedBy: ObjectId,  // ‚Üê Links to NGO's User._id
  organizationName: "Helping Hands"
}
```

---

## üîó Data Relationships (Foreign Keys)

**Each NGO's data is linked via their User ID:**

```
User (ngo_admin)
  ‚Üì
  ‚îú‚îÄ organizerId in Events
  ‚îú‚îÄ ngoId in Campaigns
  ‚îú‚îÄ authorId/creatorId in Stories & Communities
  ‚îî‚îÄ reportedBy in Reports
```

**Multiple NGOs Example:**

```
Database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Users Collection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ NGO1 (id: 111) - "Helping Hands"
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ NGO2 (id: 222) - "Save Children"
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NGO3 (id: 333) - "Medical Aid"
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Events Collection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Event A (organizerId: 111) - belongs to NGO1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Event B (organizerId: 222) - belongs to NGO2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Event C (organizerId: 111) - belongs to NGO1
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Campaigns Collection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Campaign X (ngoId: 111) - belongs to NGO1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Campaign Y (ngoId: 222) - belongs to NGO2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Campaign Z (ngoId: 333) - belongs to NGO3
```

**Each NGO can ONLY see and manage their own data!** ‚úÖ

## ‚ùå What Happens When NGO is Deleted?

### Current Implementation

The system does **NOT have an explicit NGO deletion feature** yet. Instead, it supports:

#### **Option 1: Account Suspension** (Current)
```
UPDATE users SET accountStatus = 'suspended' WHERE _id = ngoId
```
- NGO account becomes inaccessible
- All their events, campaigns, stories REMAIN in database
- Data is preserved (safe for auditing)
- NGO can be reactivated if needed

#### **Option 2: Account Deactivation** (Current)
```
UPDATE users SET isActive = false WHERE _id = ngoId
```
- NGO cannot login
- Events become hidden from public view
- Campaigns stop accepting donations
- Stories are archived
- Data is preserved

#### **Option 3: Account Soft Delete** (Current)
```
UPDATE users SET accountStatus = 'deleted' WHERE _id = ngoId
```
- Marks user as deleted but doesn't remove from database
- All linked data remains
- NGO info is hidden from listings
- Can be restored if needed

---

## üìã What SHOULD Happen (Recommended Approach)

If you want to implement true NGO deletion, here's what should happen:

### **Cascade Delete Strategy** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
When NGO is deleted:
1. ‚úÖ Delete NGO's User account
2. ‚úÖ Delete all Events created by this NGO
3. ‚úÖ Delete all Campaigns created by this NGO
4. ‚úÖ Delete all Stories posted by this NGO
5. ‚úÖ Delete all Reports filed by this NGO
6. ‚úÖ Delete all Communities created by this NGO
7. ‚úÖ Notify all registered volunteers about cancelled events
8. ‚úÖ Refund all donors for active campaigns

### **Archive Strategy** ‚úÖ ALSO GOOD
When NGO is deleted:
1. ‚úÖ Mark NGO account as deleted
2. ‚úÖ Keep all their data for records/audits
3. ‚úÖ Hide data from public view
4. ‚úÖ Preserve donor/volunteer history
5. ‚úÖ Generate compliance report

### **Hybrid Strategy** ‚úÖ BEST FOR COMPLIANCE
When NGO is deleted:
1. ‚úÖ Archive NGO's user account
2. ‚úÖ Keep campaign/donation records (legal requirement)
3. ‚úÖ Delete personal data (GDPR/privacy compliance)
4. ‚úÖ Keep public stories (historical record)
5. ‚úÖ Cancel future events with notifications

---

## üîç Real World Example

**Scenario:** You have 3 NGOs on your site:

### **Database State - BEFORE Deletion**

```
NGO 1: "Hope Foundation"
‚îú‚îÄ 5 Events (with 50 registered volunteers total)
‚îú‚îÄ 3 Campaigns (raised ‚Çπ200,000 from donors)
‚îî‚îÄ 10 Stories

NGO 2: "Care Initiative"
‚îú‚îÄ 3 Events
‚îú‚îÄ 2 Campaigns (raised ‚Çπ100,000)
‚îî‚îÄ 5 Stories

NGO 3: "Community Support"
‚îú‚îÄ 8 Events
‚îú‚îÄ 5 Campaigns (raised ‚Çπ500,000)
‚îî‚îÄ 20 Stories

TOTAL: 16 Events, 10 Campaigns, 35 Stories
```

### **If You Delete NGO 1 (Hope Foundation):**

**With Current Implementation (Suspension):**
```
‚úÖ NGO 1 account becomes suspended
‚úÖ NGO 1's 5 events remain in database (hidden)
‚úÖ NGO 1's 3 campaigns remain (donations kept)
‚úÖ NGO 1's 10 stories remain (archived)
‚úÖ All volunteer registrations preserved
‚úÖ All donation records preserved

Database State:
- NGO 1: Suspended (data still there)
- NGO 2: Active (unaffected)
- NGO 3: Active (unaffected)
```

**If We Implement Cascade Delete:**
```
‚ùå NGO 1 account deleted
‚ùå NGO 1's 5 events deleted
‚ùå NGO 1's 3 campaigns deleted
‚ùå NGO 1's 10 stories deleted
‚úÖ All volunteers notified
‚úÖ All donors refunded

Database State:
- 11 Events remaining (16 - 5)
- 7 Campaigns remaining (10 - 3)
- 25 Stories remaining (35 - 10)
- NGO 2 & 3: Unaffected
```

---

## ‚úÖ Data Isolation Verification

### Multi-NGO Queries Example

```typescript
// Get all events for NGO 1
const ngo1Events = await Event.find({ organizerId: ngo1._id });

// Get all events for NGO 2 (completely separate)
const ngo2Events = await Event.find({ organizerId: ngo2._id });

// NGO 1's events and NGO 2's events NEVER mix ‚úÖ

// Get all campaigns for specific NGO
const ngo1Campaigns = await Campaign.find({ ngoId: ngo1._id });
```

### Privacy & Security ‚úÖ

```
‚úÖ Each NGO can only see their own data
‚úÖ Volunteers for NGO 1 events don't see NGO 2's events
‚úÖ NGO 1's donation records are separate from NGO 2's
‚úÖ NGO 1's stories don't affect NGO 2's listings
```

---

## üö® Important Considerations

### **Legal/Compliance**
- ‚ùå Should NOT delete donation records (tax/audit)
- ‚ùå Should NOT delete volunteer participation records
- ‚úÖ Should delete personal contact info (GDPR)
- ‚úÖ Should archive organization info (for audits)

### **Business Impact**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deleting events cancels all registrations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deleting campaigns stops fundraising
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Volunteers lose history of events they participated in
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Donors lose history of their donations

### **Recommendation**
- ‚úÖ Use **Suspension** for temporary removal
- ‚úÖ Use **Archive** for compliance
- ‚úÖ Use **Cascade Delete** only if explicitly requested
- ‚úÖ Always keep audit logs

---

## üíª Code Implementation (Recommendation)

If you want to add deletion functionality, here's what to implement:

```typescript
export const deleteNGO = async (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { ngoId } = req.params;
    const deletionStrategy = req.body.strategy; // 'suspend', 'archive', 'delete'

    if (deletionStrategy === 'suspend') {
      // Option 1: Just suspend
      await User.findByIdAndUpdate(ngoId, { accountStatus: 'suspended' });
      // Data remains, NGO can't login
    } 
    else if (deletionStrategy === 'archive') {
      // Option 2: Archive
      await User.findByIdAndUpdate(ngoId, { isActive: false });
      // Data remains, hidden from public
    }
    else if (deletionStrategy === 'cascade') {
      // Option 3: Full deletion (with caution)
      // Delete NGO
      await User.findByIdAndDelete(ngoId);
      // Delete all events
      await Event.deleteMany({ organizerId: ngoId });
      // Delete all campaigns
      await Campaign.deleteMany({ ngoId: ngoId });
      // Delete all stories
      await Story.deleteMany({ authorId: ngoId });
      // Delete all reports
      await Report.deleteMany({ reportedBy: ngoId });
      // Notify volunteers & refund donors...
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Deletion failed' });
  }
};
```

## ‚ú® Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Is NGO data stored separately?** | ‚úÖ YES - via organizerId/ngoId |
| **Can multiple NGOs coexist?** | ‚úÖ YES - completely isolated |
| **Can NGO A see NGO B's data?** | ‚ùå NO - data access is restricted |
| **What happens when NGO is deleted?** | Currently: Suspended. Can be archived or fully deleted |
| **Are donations/volunteer records safe?** | ‚úÖ YES - data remains unless explicitly deleted |
| **Can we recover deleted NGO data?** | Depends on strategy (suspension: YES, cascade delete: NO) |
| **Is it GDPR compliant?** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement proper data deletion policies |

---

## üéØ Next Steps (If You Need Deletion)

1. **Decide on Strategy**
   - Suspension (safest)
   - Archive (balanced)
   - Cascade Delete (most aggressive)

2. **Implement Cascade Delete** (if needed)
   - Add deletion endpoint
   - Handle all related data
   - Notify users
   - Keep audit logs

3. **Add UI Controls**
   - Admin panel delete button
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Strategy selection
   - Audit logging

Would you like me to implement a proper NGO deletion endpoint with cascade delete?
