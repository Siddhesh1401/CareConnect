  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

```

## Production Considerations

### Email Service Provider
- Consider using services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES for production
- Higher reliability and delivery rates
- Better analytics and monitoring

### Environment Security
- Never commit email credentials to version control
- Use secure environment variable management
- Rotate email passwords regularly

### Performance
- Email sending is non-blocking (async)
- Failed email sends don't interrupt user registration
- Proper error logging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Not Sending:**
   - Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
   - Verify App Password if using Gmail
   - Check firewall settings for SMTP port

2. **Gmail Authentication:**
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled
   - Use App Password, not regular password
   - Check "Less Secure Apps" if not using App Password

3. **Email in Spam:**
   - Consider using verified domain
   - Add SPF/DKIM records for production
   - Use reputable email service provider

### Logs
Email operations are logged with the following format:
```
ðŸ“§ Verification email sent to: user@example.com
ðŸ“§ Approval email sent to NGO: ngo@example.com
ðŸ“§ Admin notification sent for new NGO: ngo@example.com
```
