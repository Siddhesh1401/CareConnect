# ðŸ‘¥ CareConnect Team Setup Guide

## ðŸ“§ Platform Email Setup

### Step 1: Create Team Platform Email
1. **Create a new Gmail account:**
   - Suggested: `careconnect.platform@gmail.com`
   - Or: `team.careconnect@gmail.com`
   - Use a strong password that the team can share securely

2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication:**
   - Go to Google Account Security
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - This is required for App Passwords

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to Google Account â†’ Security â†’ App Passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Save this password - you'll use it in the `.env` file

### Step 2: Team Access Management

**Option A: Shared Credentials (Recommended)**
- Share the email and app password with all team members
- Everyone uses the same configuration
- Simple and effective for small teams

**Option B: Gmail Delegation**
- Main account holder adds team members as delegates
- Each member can send emails "on behalf of" the platform
- More secure but complex setup

### Step 3: Update Configuration

1. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=careconnect.platform@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-generated-app-password
   EMAIL_FROM_NAME=CareConnect Platform
   EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=careconnect.platform@gmail.com
   ```

2. **Share the credentials securely:**
   - Use password managers (1Password, Bitwarden)
   - Encrypted messaging
   - Don't share via plain text

### Step 4: Email Templates Benefits

With your platform email, all system emails will show:
- **From:** "CareConnect Platform <careconnect.platform@gmail.com>"
- **Professional appearance** for users
- **Consistent branding** across all communications
- **Centralized email management** for the team

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices
